    <h2>Working History</h2>
    <hr>
    <ol>
        <li>QA/QC Officer Ghana National Gas Company Atuabo, Ghana (Mar 2022-Present)
        </li>
        <ul>
            <li>Responsible for conducting Ultrasonic Testing (UT) measurements for all piping, vessels and tanks in
                the plant. The remaining life of plant assets was calculated using this, which served as a basis for
                making informed management decisions on the departmental level.</li>
            <li>Led a 3-member team to analyze and process results and data from UT exercises. This was crucial to the
                development of a database to monitor the corrosion rates of piping, vessels and equipment. This further
                resulted in the early detection of a pipe leak which needed immediate attention. </li>

        </ul>
        <br>
        <li>National Service at Ghana National Gas Company Atuabo, Ghana (Oct 2020-August 2020)</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Responsible for all small bore piping inspection activities by leading a team of engineers to generate
                isometric drawings for the piping in question. This was done using P&IDs to locate them, carry out
                inspection activities on the same piping and subsequently generate reports on findings. This took a
                record one week to complete. </li>
            <li>Organising and supervising of casual workers to carry out corrosion mitigation and control activities.
                As part of this role, I was responsible for generating work permits, attending safety meetings and
                allocating duties to each worker, together with other colleagues and subsequently supervising and
                monitoring work progress. </li>
        </ul>
    </ol>
